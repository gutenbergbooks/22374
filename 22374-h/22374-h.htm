When the sun shines bright and the days grow long,<br />
And the crocuses brilliant, in purple and gold,<br />
Bloom in the gardens in numbers untold;<br />
When in the fields the grass grows green,<br />
And a few early lambs are seen;<br />
When daffodils in gaudy gowns<br />
Look gay upon the verdant downs,<br />
And fair spring flowers of each degree<br />
In every sheltered nook you see.</p>

And threw the kitten down the stairs;<br />
And Oh! far worse than all beside,<br />

<p class="verse20">It almost makes me cry to tell<br />
What foolish Harriet befell.<br />
Mamma and Nurse went out one day,<br />
And left her all alone at play;<br />
Now, on the table close at hand,<br />
A box of matches chanc&rsquo;d to stand;<br />
And kind Mamma and Nurse had told her,<br />
That if she touch&rsquo;d them, they should scold her.<br />
But Harriet said, &ldquo;Oh, what a pity!<br />
For, when they burn, it is so pretty;<br />
They crackle so, and spit, and flame;<br />
Mamma, too, often does the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse20_2">The pussy-cats heard this,<br />
And they began to hiss,<br />
And stretch their claws,<br />
And raise their paws;<br />
&ldquo;Me-ow,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;me-ow, me-o<br />
You&rsquo;ll burn to death, if you do so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="verse20_3">But Harriet would not take advice,<br />
She lit a match, it was so nice!<br />
It crackled so, it burn&rsquo;d so clear,&mdash;<br />
Exactly like the picture here.<br />
She jump&rsquo;d for joy and ran about,<br />
And was too pleas&rsquo;d to put it out.</p>

<p class="verse20_4">The pussy-cats saw this,<br />
And said, &ldquo;Oh, naughty, naughty Miss!&rdquo;<br />
And stretch&rsquo;d their claws,<br />
And rais&rsquo;d their paws;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very, very wrong, you know,<br />
Me-ow, Me-o, Me-ow, Me-o,<br />
You will be burnt, if you do so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="verse21">And see! Oh! what a dreadful thing!<br />
The fire has caught her apron-string;<br />
Her apron burns, her arms, her hair;<br />
She burns all over, every where.</p>

<p class="verse21_2">Then how the pussy-cats did mew,<br />
What else, poor pussies, could they do?<br />
They scream&rsquo;d for help, &rsquo;twas all in vain!<br />
So then, they said,&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll scream again;<br />
Make haste, make haste, me-ow, me-o<br />
She&rsquo;ll burn to death,&mdash;we told her so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="verse21_3">So she was burnt, with all her clothes,<br />
And arms, and hands, and eyes and nose;<br />
Till she had nothing more to lose<br />
Except her little scarlet shoes;<br />
And nothing else but these was found<br />
Among her ashes on the ground.</p>

<p class="verse21_4">And when the good cats sat beside<br />
The smoking ashes, how they cried!<br />
&ldquo;Me-ow, me-oo, me-ow, me-oo<br />
What will Mamma and Nursy do?&rdquo;<br />
Their tears ran down their cheeks so fast,<br />
They made a little pond at last.</p>

Then Edward, little noisy wag,<br />
Ran out and laugh&rsquo;d, and wav&rsquo;d his flag;<br />
And William came in jacket trim,<br />
And brought his wooden hoop with him;<br />
And Arthur, too, snatch&rsquo;d up his toys<br />
And join&rsquo;d the other naughty boys;<br />
So, one and all set up a roar<br />

For if he tries with all his might,<br />
He cannot change from black to white.&rdquo;<br />

<p class="verse31">Augustus was a chubby lad;<br />
Fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had;<br />
And every body saw with joy<br />
The plump and hearty healthy boy.<br />
He ate and drank as he was told,<br />
And never let his soup get cold.<br />
But one day, one cold winter&rsquo;s day!<br />
He scream&rsquo;d out&mdash;&ldquo;Take the soup away!<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse31_2">Next day, now look, the picture shows<br />
How lank and lean Augustus grows!<br />
Yet, though he feels so weak and ill,<br />
The naughty fellow cries out still&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Not any soup for me, I say:<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse31_3">The third day comes; Oh what a sin!<br />
To make himself so pale and thin.<br />
Yet, when the soup is put on table,<br />
He screams, as loud as he is able,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Not any soup for me, I say:<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse31_4">Look at him, now the fourth day&rsquo;s come<br />
He scarcely weighs a sugar-plum;<br />
He&rsquo;s like a little bit of thread;<br />
And on the fifth day, he was&mdash;dead!</p>

To sit still for once at table:<br />
Thus Papa bade Phil behave;<br />
And Mamma look&rsquo;d very grave.<br />
But fidgety Phil,<br />
He won&rsquo;t sit still;<br />
He wriggles<br />

That makes matters worse again.<br />
Down upon the ground they fall,<br />
Glasses, plates, knives, forks and all.<br />
How Mamma did fret and frown,<br />
When she saw them tumbling down!<br />
And Papa made such a face!<br />
Philip is in sad disgrace.</p>

Dishes, glasses, snapt in two!<br />
Here a knife, and there a fork!<br />

Table all so bare, and ah!<br />
Poor Papa, and poor Mamma<br />
Look quite cross, and wonder how<br />
They shall make their dinner now.</p>

And the clouds that floated by;<br />
But what just before him lay,<br />
In his way,<br />
Johnny never thought about;<br />
So that every one cried out&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Look at little Johnny there,<br />
Little Johnny Head-In-Air!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="verse35_2">Running just in Johnny&rsquo;s way,<br />
Came a little dog one day;<br />
Johnny&rsquo;s eyes were still astray<br />
Up on high,<br />
In the sky;<br />
And he never heard them cry&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Johnny, mind, the dog is nigh!&rdquo;<br />
Bump!<br />
Dump!<br />
Down they fell, with such a thump.<br />
Dog and Johnny in a lump!</p>

Johnny walk&rsquo;d beside the river.<br />
Johnny watch&rsquo;d the swallows trying<br />
Which was cleverest at flying.<br />
Oh! what fun!<br />
Johnny watch&rsquo;d the bright round sun<br />
Going in and coming out;<br />
This was all he thought about.<br />
So he strode on, only think!<br />
To the river&rsquo;s very brink,<br />
Where the bank was high and steep,<br />
And the water very deep;<br />
And the fishes, in a row,<br />
Stared to see him coming so.</p>

<p class="verse36_2">One step more! Oh! sad to tell!<br />
Headlong in poor Johnny fell.<br />
And the fishes, in dismay,<br />
Wagg&rsquo;d their tails and ran away.</p>

With his nice red writing-case;<br />
But, as they were passing by,<br />
Two strong men had heard him cry;<br />
And, with sticks, these two strong men<br />
Hook&rsquo;d poor Johnny out again.</p>

<p class="verse37_2">Oh! you should have seen him shiver<br />
When they pull&rsquo;d him from the river.<br />
He was in a sorry plight,<br />
Dripping wet, and such a fright!<br />
Wet all over, every where,<br />
Clothes, and arms, and face, and hair:<br />
Johnny never will forget<br />
What it is to be so wet.</p>

<p class="verse37_3">And the fishes, one, two, three,<br />
Are come back again, you see;<br />
Up they came the moment after,<br />
To enjoy the fun and laughter.<br />
Each popp&rsquo;d out his little head.<br />
And, to tease poor Johnny, said<br />
&ldquo;Silly little Johnny, look,<br />
You have lost your writing-book!&rdquo;</p>

Stay at home and mind their toys.<br />
Robert thought,&mdash;&ldquo;No, when it pours,<br />
It is better out of doors.&rdquo;<br />

Bob was in it.<br />
Here you see him, silly fellow,<br />
Underneath his red umbrella.</p>

<p class="verse38_2">What a wind! Oh! how it whistles<br />
Through the trees and flow&rsquo;rs and thistles!<br />
It has caught his red umbrella;<br />
Now look at him, silly fellow,<br />
Up he flies<br />
To the skies.<br />
No one heard his screams and cries;<br />
Through the clouds the rude wind bore him,<br />
And his hat flew on before him.</p>

<p class="verse38_3">Soon they got to such a height,<br />
They were nearly out of sight!<br />
And the hat went up so high,<br />
That it really touch&rsquo;d the sky.<br />
No one ever yet could tell<br />
Where they stopp&rsquo;d, or where they fell:<br />
Only, this one thing is plain,<br />
Bob was never seen again!</p>

<p class="i">In the merry spring time, thus says my song,<br />
When the sun shines bright and the days grow long,<br />
And the crocuses brilliant, in purple and gold,<br />
Bloom in the gardens in numbers untold;<br />
When in the fields the grass grows green,<br />
And a few early lambs are seen;<br />
When daffodils in gaudy gowns<br />
Look gay upon the verdant downs,<br />
And fair spring flowers of each degree<br />
In every sheltered nook you see.</p>

For, when they burn, it is so pretty;<br />
They crackle so, and spit, and flame;<br />
Mamma, too, often does the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="i">The pussy-cats heard this,<br />
And they began to hiss,<br />
And stretch their claws,<br />
And raise their paws;<br />
&ldquo;Me-ow,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;me-ow, me-o<br />
You&rsquo;ll burn to death, if you do so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="i">But Harriet would not take advice,<br />
She lit a match, it was so nice!<br />
It crackled so, it burn&rsquo;d so clear,&mdash;<br />
Exactly like the picture here.<br />
She jump&rsquo;d for joy and ran about,<br />
And was too pleas&rsquo;d to put it out.</p>

<p class="i">The pussy-cats saw this,<br />
And said, &ldquo;Oh, naughty, naughty Miss!&rdquo;<br />
And stretch&rsquo;d their claws,<br />
And rais&rsquo;d their paws;<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis very, very wrong, you know,<br />
Me-ow, Me-o, Me-ow, Me-o,<br />
You will be burnt, if you do so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="i"><a name="verse21" id="verse21"></a>And see! Oh! what a dreadful thing!<br />
The fire has caught her apron-string;<br />
Her apron burns, her arms, her hair;<br />
She burns all over, every where.</p>

<p class="i">Then how the pussy-cats did mew,<br />
What else, poor pussies, could they do?<br />
They scream&rsquo;d for help, &rsquo;twas all in vain!<br />
So then, they said,&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll scream again;<br />
Make haste, make haste, me-ow, me-o<br />
She&rsquo;ll burn to death,&mdash;we told her so&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="i">So she was burnt, with all her clothes,<br />
And arms, and hands, and eyes and nose;<br />
Till she had nothing more to lose<br />
Except her little scarlet shoes;<br />
And nothing else but these was found<br />
Among her ashes on the ground.</p>

<p class="i">And when the good cats sat beside<br />
The smoking ashes, how they cried!<br />
&ldquo;Me-ow, me-oo, me-ow, me-oo<br />
What will Mamma and Nursy do?&rdquo;<br />
Their tears ran down their cheeks so fast,<br />
They made a little pond at last.</p>

<h3><a name="verse22" id="verse22"></a>4. THE STORY OF THE INKY BOYS.</h3>

<p class="i">As he had often done before,<br />
The woolly-headed black-a-moor<br />
One nice fine summer&rsquo;s day went out<br />
To see the shops and walk about;<br />
And as he found it hot, poor fellow,<br />
He took with him his green umbrella.<br />
Then Edward, little noisy wag,<br />
Ran out and laugh&rsquo;d, and wav&rsquo;d his flag;<br />
And William came in jacket trim,<br />
And brought his wooden hoop with him;<br />
And Arthur, too, snatch&rsquo;d up his toys<br />
And join&rsquo;d the other naughty boys;<br />
So, one and all set up a roar<br />
And laugh&rsquo;d and hooted more and more,<br />
And kept on singing,&mdash;only think!&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Oh! Blacky, you&rsquo;re as black as ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="i link3"><a href="#verse22a">Return to page</a></p>



<p class="i"><a name="verse23" id="verse23"></a>Now tall Agrippa lived close by,&mdash;<br />
So tall, he almost touch&rsquo;d the sky;<br />
He had a mighty inkstand too,<br />
In which a great goose-feather grew;<br />
He call&rsquo;d out in an angry tone,<br />
&ldquo;Boys, leave the black-a-moor alone!<br />
For if he tries with all his might,<br />
He cannot change from black to white.&rdquo;<br />
But ah! they did not mind a bit<br />
What great Agrippa said of it;<br />
But went on laughing, as before,<br />
And hooting at the black-a-moor.</p>
<p class="i link3"><a href="#verse23a">Return to page</a></p>


<p class="i"><a name="verse24" id="verse24"></a>Then great Agrippa foams with rage,<br />
Look at him on this very page!<br />
He seizes Arthur, seizes Ned,<br />
Takes William by his little head;<br />
And they may scream and kick, and call,<br />
Into the ink he dips them all;<br />
Into the inkstand, one, two, three,<br />
Till they are black, as black can be;<br />
Turn over now and you shall see.</p>

<p class="i"><a name="verse25" id="verse25"></a>See, there they are, and there they run!<br />
The black-a-moor enjoys the fun.<br />
They have been made as black as crows,<br />
Quite black all over, eyes and nose,<br />
And legs, and arms, and heads, and toes,<br />
And trowsers, pinafores, and toys,&mdash;<br />
The silly little inky boys!<br />
Because they set up such a roar,<br />
And teas&rsquo;d the harmless black-a-moor.</p>

<h3><a name="verse26" id="verse26"></a>5. THE STORY OF THE MAN THAT WENT OUT SHOOTING.</h3>

<p class="i">This is the man that shoots the hares;<br />
This is the coat he always wears:<br />
With game-bag, powder-horn and gun,<br />
He&rsquo;s going out to have some fun.</p>

<p class="i">He finds it hard, without a pair<br />
Of spectacles, to shoot the hare:<br /></p>

<p class="i">The hare sits snug in leaves and grass,<br />
And laughs to see the green man pass.</p>

<p class="i">Now, as the sun grew very hot,<br />
And he a heavy gun had got,<br />
He lay down underneath a tree<br />
And went to sleep, as you may see.<br />
And, while he slept like any top,<br />
The little hare came, hop, hop, hop,&mdash;<br />
Took gun and spectacles, and then<br />
On her hind legs went off again.</p>

The spectacles upon her face;<br />
And now she&rsquo;s trying, all she can,<br />
To shoot the sleepy green-coat man.<br />

And hears him call out every where,<br />
&ldquo;Help! Fire! Help! The Hare! The Hare!&rdquo;</p>

Bang went the gun,&mdash;she miss&rsquo;d her mark!</p>

<p class="i">The poor man&rsquo;s wife was drinking up<br />
Her coffee in her coffee-cup;<br />
The gun shot cup and saucer through<br />
&ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;what shall I do?&rdquo;<br />
There liv&rsquo;d close by the cottage there<br />
The hare&rsquo;s own child, the little hare;<br />
And while she stood upon her toes,<br />
The coffee fell and burn&rsquo;d her nose,<br />
&ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; she cried, with spoon in hand,<br />
&ldquo;Such fun I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

I must go out and leave you here.<br />
But mind now, Conrad, what I say,<br />
Don&rsquo;t suck your thumb while I&rsquo;m away.<br />
The great tall tailor always comes<br />
To little boys that suck their thumbs;<br />
And ere they dream what he&rsquo;s about,<br />

And cuts their thumbs clean off,&mdash;and then,<br />

<h3><a name="verse31" id="verse31"></a>7. THE STORY OF AUGUSTUS WHO WOULD NOT HAVE ANY SOUP.</h3>

<p class="i">Augustus was a chubby lad;<br />
Fat ruddy cheeks Augustus had;<br />
And every body saw with joy<br />
The plump and hearty healthy boy.<br />
He ate and drank as he was told,<br />
And never let his soup get cold.<br />
But one day, one cold winter&rsquo;s day!<br />
He scream&rsquo;d out&mdash;&ldquo;Take the soup away!<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day.&rdquo;</p>

How lank and lean Augustus grows!<br />

The naughty fellow cries out still&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Not any soup for me, I say:<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="i">The third day comes; Oh what a sin!<br />
To make himself so pale and thin.<br />
Yet, when the soup is put on table,<br />
He screams, as loud as he is able,&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Not any soup for me, I say:<br />
O take the nasty soup away!<br />
I won&rsquo;t have any soup to-day!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="i">Look at him, now the fourth day&rsquo;s come<br />

Be a little gentleman;<br />

To sit still for once at table:<br />
Thus Papa bade Phil behave;<br />

It was always Johnny&rsquo;s rule<br />
To be looking at the sky<br />
And the clouds that floated by;<br />

Johnny never thought about;<br />
So that every one cried out&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Look at little Johnny there,<br />
Little Johnny Head-In-Air!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="i">Running just in Johnny&rsquo;s way,<br />
Came a little dog one day;<br />

Up on high,<br />

Oh! what fun!<br />
Johnny watch&rsquo;d the bright round sun<br />
Going in and coming out;<br />
This was all he thought about.<br />
So he strode on, only think!<br />
To the river&rsquo;s very brink,<br />
Where the bank was high and steep,<br />
And the water very deep;<br />
And the fishes, in a row,<br />
Stared to see him coming so.</p>

<p class="i">One step more! Oh! sad to tell!<br />

When they pull&rsquo;d him from the river.<br />
He was in a sorry plight,<br />
Dripping wet, and such a fright!<br />
Wet all over, every where,<br />
Clothes, and arms, and face, and hair:<br />
Johnny never will forget<br />
What it is to be so wet.</p>

Are come back again, you see;<br />
Up they came the moment after,<br />
To enjoy the fun and laughter.<br />

In the country or the town,<br />
All good little girls and boys<br />
Stay at home and mind their toys.<br />
Robert thought,&mdash;&ldquo;No, when it pours,<br />
It is better out of doors.&rdquo;<br />
Rain it <i>did</i>, and in a minute<br />
Bob was in it.<br />
Here you see him, silly fellow,<br />
Underneath his red umbrella.</p>

<p class="i">What a wind! Oh! how it whistles<br />
Through the trees and flow&rsquo;rs and thistles!<br />
It has caught his red umbrella;<br />
Now look at him, silly fellow,<br />
Up he flies<br />
To the skies.<br />
No one heard his screams and cries;<br />
Through the clouds the rude wind bore him,<br />
And his hat flew on before him.</p>

<p class="i">Soon they got to such a height,<br />
They were nearly out of sight!<br />
And the hat went up so high,<br />
That it really touch&rsquo;d the sky.<br />

Where they stopp&rsquo;d, or where they fell:<br />
Only, this one thing is plain,<br />
Bob was never seen again!</p>
